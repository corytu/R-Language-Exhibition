# R Language Playground
__*This respository is NOT intended to be licensed. Please be aware that copyright laws apply.*__

## Here are two branches
### master (code files and documents)
* R_Tutorial.pdf: A tutorial I gave to BLP in Oct 2016.
* ui.R and server.R: Shiny app based on data from R built-in "airquality".
* cachematrix.R: Create and cache a matrix. Find its inverse matrix if it exists.

### gh-pages (public html pages)
* Plotting with R ggplot2: Organizing scatter plots, bar plots, and faceting. Slides are done with R markdown tools.
* Air quality in New York in 1973: Using "airquality" data frame in R and demonstrating a simple shiny application.
* Taiwan National Parks: Showing all nine national parks in Taiwan (Feb 2017) with leaflet and R.
* Play mtcars: A simple plotly demonstration with "mtcars" data frame in R.

## Others
* I might organize and publish some personal notes of R here (in Mandarin), but it is not one of my priorities now.
