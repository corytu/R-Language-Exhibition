# R Language Playground
__*This respository is NOT intended to be licensed.*__

## Hello World!
* My name is Yu-Zhen, and I am from Taiwan. Welcome to my playground for R language.

## Tutorial Slides
* <a href="https://corytu.github.io/R_Language_Playground/Plotting_with_R_ggplot2.html">Plotting with R: ggplot2</a> (Mar 2017)
* <a href="https://github.com/corytu/R_Language_Playground/blob/master/R_Tutorial_20161012_BLP.pdf">R Programming tutorial</a> (Oct 2016)

## Project Demonstration
* <a href="https://corytu.shinyapps.io/airquality/">My first Shiny app</a> (ui.R and server.R are in the master branch of this repository) (Feb 2017)<br>
It uses "airquality" data frame in R and plots the relationship between selected variables. Details are available <a href="https://corytu.github.io/R_Language_Playground/Air_Quality_in_New_York_in_1973.html">here</a>.
* <a href="https://corytu.github.io/R_Language_Playground/Taiwan_National_Parks.html">Taiwan National Parks</a> (Feb 2017)<br>
It shows all nine national parks in Taiwan. The hyperlinks to each national park are provided once users click the markers.
* <a href="https://corytu.github.io/R_Language_Playground/play_mtcars_dataset.html">Playing mtcars dataset</a> (Feb 2017)<br>
It is a rather simple presentation with plotly tool. The data are from R built-in "mtcars" dataset.

## Others
* I might organize and publish some personal notes of R here (in Mandarin), but it is not one of my priorities now.

# Here are two branches if you view on GitHub:
## master (code files and documents)
* R_Tutorial.pdf: A tutorial I gave to BLP in Oct 2016.
* ui.R and server.R: Shiny app based on data from R built-in "airquality".
* cachematrix.R: Create and cache a matrix. Find its inverse matrix if it exists.

## gh-pages (public html pages)
* Plotting with R ggplot2: Organizing scatter plots, bar plots, and faceting. Slides are done with R markdown tools.
* Air quality in New York in 1973: Using "airquality" data frame in R and demonstrating a simple shiny application.
* Taiwan National Parks: Showing all nine national parks in Taiwan (Feb 2017) with leaflet and R.
* Play mtcars dataset: A simple plotly demonstration with "mtcars" data frame in R.
